### Conversational Information Retrieval for Instructional Content â€“ A Modeling Framework and an Implementation for Recipe Search


This is an incomplete backup of the coding part of my bachelor thesis which includes a prototype recipe search application as an Alexa skill and the crawling and mining of its dataset. However the dataset itself is not included in this repository.

#### Abstract
As commercial voice agents are becoming increasingly popular, conversational search is brought into focus. Being an emerging area of research, there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered.  
In this thesis, we aim to provide some insight into what a speech-based conversational search system might look like, focusing on its application in recipe search, as cooking is a typical hands-off situation where voice interactions and information retrieval with an agent afford more convenience. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) a human-like conversational information retrieval model, and (2) a prototype of conversational recipe search.
